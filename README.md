# ProST: Procedural Synthesis Transformer
## AI-Powered 3D CAD Modeling System

### What is ProST?
ProST is a revolutionary AI system that converts natural language descriptions into precise, manufacturable 3D CAD models. Think of it as having an expert engineer who can understand your words and create professional-quality 3D designs.

### The Core Concept
Instead of just generating "pretty shapes" like most AI 3D tools, ProST creates engineering-grade models that are:
- Dimensionally accurate (exact measurements)
- Manufacturable (can be 3D printed or machined)
- Professionally designed (meets industry standards)

### How It Works (4-Step Process)
1. **Semantic Decomposer**: Reads your text and converts it into step-by-step construction commands
2. **Procedural Synthesis Kernel**: Executes those commands with mathematical precision (like a CAD program)
3. **Geometric Refinement Network**: Adds subtle details and refinements to make it look professional
4. **Self-Correction Loop**: Checks the final model for errors and fixes any issues

### Example Usage
Input: "Create a 12oz aluminum soda can with a pull-tab top"
Output: A precise 3D model with exact dimensions, proper materials, and manufacturing specifications

### Key Innovation
ProST combines the creativity of AI language models with the precision of professional CAD software, creating the first system capable of generating real-world, usable 3D designs from simple text descriptions.

### Target Applications
- Rapid prototyping
- Product design
- Engineering education
- Manufacturing automation
- Creative design workflows

This represents a major leap from "AI art" to "AI engineering" - where the output is not just visually appealing but functionally precise and ready for real-world use.
